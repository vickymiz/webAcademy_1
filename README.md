first things first

**Hi!** *I am Vicky, I am 20*
- I study at NUPT as a hotel-restaurant specialist, but I decided to become a front-end developer a few months ago.
- My sister showed me the HTML and CSS and I enjoyed it.
- I want to start learning more structurable than I studied by myself before. 
- I was learning with YouTube and JetBrains. But it is very difficult for me, when you have no possibility to ask sth at once. 

`So, I am here.`
